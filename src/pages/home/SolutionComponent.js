              1. Use Strong Passwords and a Password Manager
            </div>
            <p>
              ‚Ä¢ Using strong passwords increases your protection against brute
              force attacks.
              <br />
              <br />‚Ä¢ These attacks happen when a cybercriminal, or ‚Äúthreat
              actor,‚Äù uses software that generates random and known passwords
              (acquired from data breaches) to try to guess what your password
              is.
              <br />
              <br />‚Ä¢ Password managers come in handy for keeping strong
              passwords. With a Password Manager, you only need to remember one
              password. Once you enter the master password, the password manager
              will fetch and input the password in the form you‚Äôre filling out
              (assuming you‚Äôve already stored the information in the password
              manager). Therefore, you can use extremely strong and lengthy
              passwords without worrying about remembering them, and without
              writing your passwords on a post-it note.

              2. Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
            </div>
            <p>
              ‚Ä¢ The first layer of protection between your account and someone
              else accessing it is your password. The second layer is two-factor
              authentication (2FA). You should be using it to add an extra
              blanket of security to your accounts.
              <br />
              <br />‚Ä¢ 2FA is, at its most basic, an identity verification
              software. If you (or the threat actor) enter the correct password
              to your account, 2FA will kick in and require you to verify your
              identity, most often by entering a series of random numbers or
              letters sent to you via SMS (cellphone texts) or by an app.
              <br />
              <br />‚Ä¢ Enabling 2FA will keep your account safe even if the
              attacker does gain access to your Password.

              ‚Ä¢ Using privacy-focused apps may not only help prevent you from
              being a victim of cybercrime, but it also allows you to protect
              your personal information from being captured, such as your
              contacts, browsing history, ad interactions, and more.

              5. Double-Check Before You Click a Link
            </div>
            <p>
              ‚Ä¢ Phishing is one of the most common forms of cyber attack.
              Phishing is a form of cyberattack that is delivered mainly by
              email, but also by SMS.
              <br />
              <br />‚Ä¢ The threat actor tries to entice you to click a bogus link
              that will take you to a website that‚Äôs masquerading as an official
              entity, or even download a virus on your device
              <br />
              <br />‚Ä¢ Before you click any link, double-check that it‚Äôs the true
              source you want to visit. The difference can be as minor as
              ‚Äúarnazon.com‚Äù and ‚Äúamazon.com‚Äù.

            <p>
              ‚Ä¢ Public Wi-Fi is a great thing in a pinch, but it's not a good
              idea to connect to a public Wi-Fi network unless you absolutely
              have to. If you do connect to a public Wi-Fi network, make sure
              you connect to a VPN. Otherwise, your traffic may be exposed to
              anyone on that network.
              <br />
              <br />‚Ä¢ Worse yet, if you send any sensitive data across the
              network without encryption (like HTTPS), that data could be
              intercepted by the network operator or other people on the
              network. It‚Äôs never a good idea to send sensitive data over
              unencrypted HTTP, but it‚Äôs especially dangerous to do so on a
              public Wi-Fi network.
              <br />
              <br />‚Ä¢ The best solution is to do those sensitive tasks from your
              own private network. If you‚Äôre in public and have to do something
              urgent, use your cellular data to play it safe. If that‚Äôs not an
              option, it‚Äôs a good idea to connect to a VPN.
